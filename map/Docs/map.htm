<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font
 color="#000000"><u>General Changes: </u>The map has been split into a
greater number of territories. This will make it more difficult to
transfer forces from one theatre to another. A fighter stationed in
France can not be used for an attack in West Russia on the same round.
A transport off the coast of Algeria can no longer land in Norway.
Forces must be committed to the appropriate theatre BEFORE the critical
moment. This will benefit skilled players because mistakes will be
harder to correct. For example, if Germany over-commits to the Eastern
Front, and the Allies make a landing in Northwest France, Germany will
be forced to transfer forces from the East. The extra time it takes to
move them will neutralize those forces for the duration of the
transfer. </font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font
 color="#000000">While unit costs have gone up, territory values have
gone down. It is no longer worth throwing away an infantry unit simply
for the IPC value of most territories. This does not mean that
territories are not worth capturing. It may be worthwhile to sacrifice
an infantry when used as a buffer against a large enemy force to buy
time to build up a large counter force. The choice of the appropriate
move will now be harder to make as it will be dictated by the
situation, not the IPC value of the territory.</font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font
 color="#000000"><u>Historical Context: </u>While capturing ground and
resources was important, destroying the enemy’s forces was of greater
importance. The battle of Kursk is arguably the most decisive of the
entire war. The contested ground was relatively worthless, but the
number of units involved leant the battle its importance. </font></p>

<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font
 color="#000000">The many subdivisions offer more opportunity for
maneuver. Furthermore, with the increased distance between the Soviet
and German capitols, the further a player advances, the more difficult
the task becomes. The attacker is pulling away from new reinforcements,
the defender is falling back on them. This allows opportunities for the
retreating army to deliver "backhand blows" adding excitement to the
game. It also simulates the supply difficulties felt by Germany in
1941-'42 and the Soviets in '44-'45.</font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font

The Russian Player can not transfer forces from one to the other as
easily when confronted with unforeseen events. </font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font
 color="#000000">The Strategic importance of West Russia has increased.
German troops massed there simultaneously threaten Stalingrad, Russia,
Archangel, Karelia, Tver and even Kazakh. When held by the Soviets it
converts the new impassible territory (Prypet Marshes) into a wedge,
forcing Axis units to split, or leave either the North or South open
to a Red Army attack. </font></p>

 color="#000000">The battle for North Africa is made less linear by the
addition of Tobruk. It contains an industrial complex to signify the
importance of the port. Meanwhhile, Egypt remains the gateway to lower
Africa. Losing control of either will be a blow to the Allies, but
splitting forces could result in the loss of both.</font></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;"><font
 color="#000000">The overall value of sub-Saharan Africa has been
decreased. Though Africa contained vast untapped resources, the
infrastructure was fairly poor and the already stretched war economies
of the major powers could not devote resources for development and
extraction of those resources. </font></p>
<p class="western"

Italy) is now a third canal. Its strategic importance is not as great
as the Suez or Panama, but it does allow the side that controls Sicily
greater freedom of movement in the Mediterranean<br>

 color="#000000">The value of Finland has been increased to reflect
that it was a major source of Iron Ore for the Axis powers. An
industrial complex has been added to reflect both that Finland was a
major player amongst the minor powers, and that when defeated, Finland
attacked German forces. </font></p>

the port of Danzig and the fact that East Prussia was considered the
spiritual home of the German army. Its loss was a major blow to German
morale.</font></p>
