<div style="text-align: center;"><b>THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES<br>
</b>The total units on the board have been roughly doubled. The cost of
land units has been roughly doubled. The total income on the board has
only been increased by only one third.<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><u><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
Units</span></u><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><u>Changes:</u> New units that can be
placed each round will represent a dramatically smaller fraction of the
total forces. Players will have to use starting units more
intelligently as heavy losses will be difficult to replace. </div>
</div>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Furthermore, if a
skilled player out-maneuvers a less skilled one, it will have a greater
effect. For example, if Germany masses in the Ukraine they will likely
draw Russian forces to Stalingrad. Germany can then capture West
Russia, and be on Moscow&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s doorstep. The Soviets will send
everything they can to defend their capitol but, their infantry will
not make it, and they will not be able to afford many new ones to place
in Moscow, leaving their high value pieces vulnerable. With high value
pieces harder to replace, this could spell total disaster for the
Allies.<br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Historical Context:</u>
The game officially opens on June 1, 1942. At this point every country
but the United States was fully mobilized. They continued to call up
new recruits throughout the war, but these were barely enough to
replace the casualties being suffered. Those casualties, in turn,
represented a relatively small proportion of the forces in the field.
On the rare occasion that a large force was lost, it was devastating.
For example, the Wermarch never fully recovered from the loss of the
Sixth Army at Stalingrad.<br>
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><u style="font-weight: bold;">Naval
Units<br>
</u>
<div style="text-align: left;"><u>Changes:</u> A loss of a major fleet
is no longer more devastating than the loss of a major army. Players
can afford to be more daring and take bigger risks with them.<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">The lower relative expense of naval
units versus air units allows players to split their fleets more often.
It is no longer worth sacrificing a fighter to take out an enemy's
destroyer, meaning transports can be protected by a weak naval force,
so long as it does not encounter an enemy fleet.<br>
</div>
</div>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Historical Context:</u>
While the largest proportion of naval power remained in large task
forces, convoys, usually escorted by a small number of cruisers and/or
destroyers, were often formed to transfer/distribute resources as
needed. </p>
