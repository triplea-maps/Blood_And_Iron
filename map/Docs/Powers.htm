<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in; text-align: center;"><u><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Minor Axis Powers:</span><br>
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt=""

</u></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
countries that both remained autonomous within the
framework of the Axis Powers, and maintained independent armed forces
which they committed to the conflict. As the most powerful of these
countries, Italy has been set as the capitol.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">Having
drawn IPCs from Germany, the Lower Axis will have to strike a balance
between supporting the German effort on the Eastern Front and staying
powerful in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in; text-align: center;"><u
 style="font-weight: bold;">Soviet_Union:</u><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt=""

</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
Soviet Union has been strengthened economically. The Revised Edition
makes this country far weaker than its historical counterpart. By 1945
the Red Army was the largest in the world. Though Soviet contributions
to the war tend to be downplayed by Western powers, they made
the greatest contribution to Germany’s defeat.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">With
the preponderance of Soviet wealth now West of Moscow, merely holding
on until the Western Allies come to the rescue is no longer a viable
option. However, if the Allies can tie down enough German Resources, a
skilled Russian player may be able to win the war for the allies.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in; text-align: center;"><u><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Germany:</span><br>
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt=""
 src="Images/Flags/Germany_large.png"><br>
</u></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
independent Lower Axis player has robbed Germany of a great deal of
wealth, but Germany has benefited more from initial units than any
other country. </p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">Tight
coordination with the Lower Axis player will be necessary for success.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in; text-align: center;"><u
 style="font-weight: bold;">United Kingdom:</u> <br>
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt=""
 src="Images/Flags/United_Kingdom_large.png"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
UK was an empire in decline. By 1942 the British were stretched
incredibly thin attempting to defend their territories around the
world. They were masters of a world class system of infrastructure, but
no longer had the resources to leverage it. To simulate this, the UK's
IPCs have been reduced, but they posses more industrial complexes than
any other nation. (Four) </p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
British can be powerful in any theatre they chose, but can not afford
to be powerful in all at once, making their industrial complexes as
much a liability as they are a blessing.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in; text-align: center;"><u
 style="font-weight: bold;">Japan:</u> <br>
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt=""
 src="Images/Flags/Japan_large.png"><br>
</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">Japan's
IPC have seen a slight shift into the pacific islands. This encourages
the Japanese to emphasize naval and air power. Faced with two allied
complexes in Asia and reduced value of mainland territories, it will be
more difficult for Japan to dominate the Asian mainland while warding
off the American Navy.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">Japan
can likely capture either China or India while effectively protecting
the Pacific Islands. To attempt all three could stretch them too thin,
and like the British complexes, the high value of the pacific islands
could be a curse in disguise.</p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in; text-align: center;"><u
 style="font-weight: bold;">United States:<br>
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt=""
 src="Images/Flags/United_States_large.png"><br>
</u></p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
United States player has a much stronger presence in the Pacific. The
increased value of the Pacific Islands, the elimination of the
Northeast Canada-&gt;Algeria shortcut, and an economically stronger
Soviet Union all combine to make the Pacific worth fighting for. </p>
<p class="western"
 style="margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 0.2in;">The
US is the economic powerhouse, but is furthest from the crucial
sectors. In a game designed to create difficult choices for all
players, striking the right balance of resources between the Atlantic
and Pacific may be the most challenging and rewarding.</p>
